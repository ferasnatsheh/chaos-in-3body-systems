Investigating Deterministic Chaos in Three-Body Systems

This project was part of a college course, PHYS-300: Computational Physics, taken Fall 2023 at Whitman College. 
I am in the process of expanding my work on this proejct and publishing it on Medium and other journals. 

It is easiest to run this project in a Google Colab environment because installing Manim there is quite straightforward and does not require it locally. 

This project received a 100% grade
